<!-- The app must be a authenticated app. It can accept fake login with details, username: foo, password: bar.
Post login route is '/home'. This route shows our main list UI. This page shouldn't be accessible by non logged in users.
logged in pages must show logout button. On click of this logout it will redirect to the login page.
There's no need to implement a server for fake login functionality. We're not going to judge you for doing so.
UI must be built using react.
The list is a contact list of user and photo. It can look like this. This design is just for your reference. Any deviations from this design is fine. There's no need for drop down or drawers. Just a list is sufficient.
It should look correct at least for a 320x480 sized view-port.
You can use a static list of users like this or use this free random user api if you fancy that.
Initially only load a partial list and when user scrolls to end of page. App shows loading feedback and loads more contacts after a delay of 1 sec.
You can use any open source lib. That's fine. -->
